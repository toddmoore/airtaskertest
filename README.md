##Airtasker Javascript Test

Thanks for your interest in Airtasker.  As part of our hiring process Airtasker likes to ask candidates to complete a short exercise.  It is designed to allow candidates to show off their coding skills and helps us assess a candidate's abilities.

The exercise should take between 2 and 4 hours to complete.

###Objective

You have been provided with "main.js".  This is the entry point of the application.  This script will load the JSON file "activity_feed.json" which is parsed and then passed to an empty method "solution.generateActivityList".  You can run the script with

    node main.js

Your task is to implement the "generateActivityList" method.  This method is expected to generate HTML that matches the example in "expected_output.html".

You can test your output against the expected output with

    node test.js

We encourage you to ask any questions about the exercise.

You are not restricted to a single function or file.  You can structure your solution however you like.

You are welcome to use any node modules or third party libraries you see fit.

To complete the exercise please zip up your solution and email it back to us so we can review your submission.

Best of luck ;)
